RAM Storage Box V2 by dambergn on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2101767

Summary:
New Version: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3789596This is a PC RAM storage box I designed.  It is not that complicated but I have yet to find anything like it available so I made one.  This can store either desktop size ram modules or laptop modules.  I may make revisions to it in the future as I become more skilled with CAD.
